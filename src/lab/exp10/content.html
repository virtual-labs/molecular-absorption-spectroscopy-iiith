Information regarding the kinetics of many reactions has been obtained by using UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy. The progress of a reaction, i.e., change in the concentrations of the reactants or products can be followed spectrophotometrically if one of them is a light absorbing substance. For example, oxidation or reduction reaction of organic dyes can be easily followed by the absorption spectroscopy method, since the dyes are coloured compounds. In addition to organic and inorganic coloured compounds, some metal particles in their dispersed states show distinct colours. Therefore, formation of such particles from the reduction of metal ions by some reducing agent can also be studied by using UV-visible spectrophotometry. In this experiment we study first the formation of different sized gold particles in aqueous surfactant medium and then study the reduction of an organic dye, eosin, by sodium borohydride catalysed by these particles.

<b>Kinetics of Gold Particle Formation Reaction:</b> When light falls on small metal particles, the light can excite collective coherent oscillations of surface electron-gas at the interface of the metal particle and dielectric. This collective coherent oscillation of metal surface electron-gas in metal particles is known as localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). LSPR falls in the visible range of electromagnetic spectrum for some metals like gold, silver and copper. Therefore, formation and development of such particles with LSPR property can be studied by using absorption spectroscopy. Metal particles can, in principle, be prepared by the reduction of their ions in suitable reaction media. For example, addition of sodium borohydride, a reducing agent to a yellow coloured aqueous gold(III) ion solution produces purple coloured dispersion of gold particles. Since silver and gold ions can be easily reduced, photo-irradiations of such ions in the presence of molecules like Triton-X 100 (TX-100), alcohols, etc. can also reduce them to metallic states. In this experiment, TX-100, a neutral surfactant is used as the reducing agent-cum-particle stabilizer. This photo-irradiation generates very small gold particles. These small gold particles can be used as seed particles and can be grown further into larger sized particles by addition of more gold ions and reducing them with the help of a weak reducing agent, such as ascorbic acid (Table 1). A weak reducing agent is necessary in this step so that nucleation (reduction) occurs only on the surface of the seed particles and seed particles grow in sizes but no new particles form via homogeneous nucleation. This ensures the formation of nearly monodispersed larger sized particle formation. Nearly spherical colloidal gold particles are purple in colour and absorb around wavelength 530 nm. 
Since the particle growth reaction is relatively slow, the growth reaction can be easily followed by a spectrophotometer. The growth of the particles starting from the seed can be followed spectrophotometrically due the change in absorbance during the particle growth process. Various sized gold particle samples can be prepared by varying the ratio of seed to gold ion concentrations. The development of seed-mediated larger gold particles shows sigmoidal shaped curve when increase in absorbance vs. time is plotted. This suggests an autoctalytic growth of the particles. This can be verified by an autocatalytic plot for the development of absorbance with respect to time i.e., ln a/(1-a) vs. t where a =A<sub>t</sub>/A<sub>∞</sub>, with A being absorbance. 
<b>Kinetics of Gold Particle-Catalysed Reduction of Eosin by Sodium Borohydride:</b> Eosin is an organic water soluble bright red dye used in many applications in biological science, medical science, textile dying, ink manufacturing, etc. Its reduced form is colourless and hence its reduction can be monitored easily by following the decrease in its absorption peak intensity. Decrease in eosin absorbance was followed at 535 nm wavelength. In the absence of particles, one does not observe the sign of reduction of eosin by sodium borohydride in aqueous solution in the experimental time scale. However, the rate of reduction becomes appreciably faster in the presence of gold particles. Gold particles here act as catalysts. Depending on the gold particle size and concentration (Table 1), the rate of reduction varies, though all the sets of particles prepared here have the same amount of total gold (1×10<sup>-4</sup> M).
A pseudo-first order kinetics with respect to eosin, i.e., log (A<sub>t</sub> – A<sub>Au</sub>) vs. time (t) could be used in this case, where A<sub>t</sub> stands for the absorbance at any time t and A<sub>Au</sub> that for aqueous gold particle system before the addition of dye. Thus one can determine the values of pseudo-first-order rate constants (k) and corresponding correlation coefficients from these plots.

<b>A. 	Preparation of Gold Seed Solution.</b>
<ol>
<li> 2.94 mL 10<sup>-2</sup> M TX-100 and 0.06 mL 4.975 × 10<sup>-3</sup> M Au-(III) (HAuCl4. xH2O) solutions are taken in a 1 cmquartz cuvette.
</li>
 <li> The cuvette is kept about 3 cm away from a germicidal (UV) lamp and is irradiated with the UV light for 30 min.
The yellow colored solution turns purple indicating the formation of fine colloidal gold nanoparticles.
</li> 
<li> Turn on the spectrophotometer instrument by clicking on the power button and wait for 30 min for initialization of the instrument.
</li> 
<li> Click on the spectrophotometer lid to open it.
</li> 
<li>  	Click on the Au seed solution cuvette to place it in the sample cell holder of the instrument.
One has to use aqueous TX-100 solution as the sample blank or reference in this measurement. Here a double beam spectrophotometer is shown. 
</li> 
<li>  	Run the wavelength scan by clicking on the Computer monitor and then on the ‘Scan’ tab and observe the scan. In the real spectrophotometer, an appropriate wavelength range of incident light for the sample can be chosen and the wavelength scan are run via the accompanied computer software. One can run the scan in absorbance or transmittance mode. The scan data is stored in the computer. 
</li> 
<li>  	Click on the spectrophotometer lid again to open it. 
</li> 
<li>  	Click on the cuvette to take it out to the instrument table.</li>
<li>  	Collect data by clicking on the Data tab.</li>
<li>  	Plot the absorbance (and transmittance) of the sample at various wavelengths and determine the wavelength of maximum absorption i.e., spectral peak-position. Colloidal gold particles absorb maximum light near wavelength 520 nm.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b>B. 	Preparation of Various-Sized Colloidal Gold Particles and Kinetic Studies of Their Evolution.</b>
The seed particles are left generally for 3-4 h before employing them for the generation of larger gold particles. Various sized colloidal gold particles can be prepared by a two-step seed mediated (non-iterative) growth method. 
The conditions for preparing gold particles of three different sizes are given in the following table.  
<ol>
<li>Turn on the spectrophotometer instrument by clicking on the power button and wait for 30 min for initialization of the instrument.</li>
<li>For the preparation of Sample 1 gold particle proceed as follows. </li>
<li>Take the micropipette by clicking on it.</li>

<li>Click on the micropipette again to collect the required quantity of seed solution.</li>
<li>Add the seed solution from micropipette to the required quantity of Au(III) ion solution in the cuvette by clicking on the pipette once again.</li>
<li> Add 0.04 mL 10-2 M ascorbic acid at a time (not drop by drop) by clicking on the ascorbic acid solution.</li>
<li> Immediately after addition of ascorbic acid, the kinetics of the particle development from the seed should be followed by following the increase in absorbance value at &lambda;=520 nm with time (at 331°C). </li>
<li>Click on the spectrophotometer lid to open it.</li>
<li>Click on the cuvette to place it in the sample cell holder of the instrument.
One has to use water as the sample blank or reference in this measurement. Here a double beam spectrophotometer is shown. In this case, one can place the sample in the sample holder and the sample bank or reference in the reference holder simultaneously.</li>
<li>Close the chamber lid by clicking on it.</li>
<li>Click on the computer monitor to open the scan page.</li>
<li>Run the scan in the kinetics mode by clicking on the ‘Scan’ button and observe the scan. In the real spectrophotometer, an appropriate wavelength of light is selected (here &lambda;=520 nm) at which increase in absorbance vs. time scan is performed by using the accompanied computer software.</li>
<li>When the scan is complete click on the ‘Next’ tab for beginning the kinetic measurements of Sample 2 and Sample 3.</li>
<li>Repeat the above steps and study the developments of Sample 2 and Sample 3 gold particles. Thus one prepares various-sized gold particles depending on the seed particle to Au(III) ion concentration ratio. All the samples left for ~12 hrs before using them as catalysts for eosin reduction. The rate of catalysis was found to be very slow within 3-4 hrs of their preparations.</li>
<li>Collect data by clicking on the Data tab. </li>
<li>Plot the absorbance vs. time for the sample. What is the nature of the plot: sigmoidal?</li>
<li>Attempt an autocatalytic fit of the data.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b>C. 	Catalytic Eosin Reduction Kinetics Study.</b>
<ol>
<li>	Turn on the spectrophotometer instrument by clicking on the power button and wait for 30 min for initialization of the instrument.</li>
<li>	Take 2 mL of a sample containing particles of a given average size in a cuvette. </li>
<li>    Click on the micropipette to add 0.04 mL 10<sup>-2</sup> M eosin solution and then 0.40 mL 0.50 M sodium borohydride (NaBH4) solution to the particle solution present in the cuvette.</li>  
<li>Immediately after the addition of NaBH4, kinetics of particle catalyzed eosin reduction is followed by following the decrease in absorbance value at &lambda;=535 nm with time (at 30 1 °C).</li> 
<li> Click on the spectrophotometer lid to open it. </li>
<li> Click on the cuvette to place it in the sample cell holder of the instrument.
One has to use water as the sample blank or reference in this measurement. Here a double beam spectrophotometer is shown. In this case, one can place the sample in the sample holder (often the front one) and the sample bank or reference in the reference holder (often the back one) simultaneously.</li>
<li> Close the spectrophotometer lid by clicking on it. </li>
<li> Run the scan in the kinetics mode by clicking on the Computer monitor and then on the ‘Scan’ tab and observe the scan. In the real spectrophotometer, an appropriate wavelength of light is selected (here &lambda;=535 nm) at which decrease in absorbance vs. time scan is performed by using the accompanied computer software.</li>
<li>When the scan is complete click on the ‘Next’ tab for beginning the kinetic measurements with Sample 2 and Sample 3.</li>
<li>Repeat the above steps and study the kinetics of catalytic reduction of eosin by Sample 2 and Sample 3 gold particles.</li>
<li>Collect data by clicking on the ‘Data’ tab.</li>
<li>Plot the absorbance vs. time for every sample. What is the nature of the plot?</li>
<li>Attempt a first order fit of the data.</li>
